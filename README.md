# ZeroCopyReadWrite
<p> This program performs zero copy read and write operation while reading or writing data from the file. We directly use Kernal buffer to perform read and write operations without making any user defined buffers. Moreover, it also multi-threaded program and is a solution to reader-writer synchronization problem. </p>
